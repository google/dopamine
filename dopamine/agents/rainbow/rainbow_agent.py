"""Compact implementation of a simplified Rainbow agent.

Specifically, we implement the following components from Rainbow:

  * n-step updates;
  * prioritized replay; and
  * distributional RL.

These three components were found to significantly impact the performance of
the Atari game-playing agent.

Furthermore, our implementation does away with some minor hyperparameter
choices. Specifically, we

  * keep the beta exponent fixed at beta=0.5, rather than increase it linearly;
  * remove the alpha parameter, which was set to alpha=0.5 throughout the paper.

Hessel et al. (2018).
